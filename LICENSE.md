To the extent this PASSION License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

## Section 1 -- Definitions.

  d. **“Effective Technological Measures”** means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

  i. **“Share”** means to provide material to any third party, by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to any such third party including in ways that such third parties or members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.

  j. **“Sui Generis Database Rights”** means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

## Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. **License grant.**

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this PASSION License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable (except as set forth herein), non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
           
            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part, **for non-commercial purposes only**;  
            
            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material, **for non-commercial purposes only**.
            
            Commercial use of the Licensed Material is strictly prohibited under this PASSION License.

       2. **Exceptions and Limitations.**  
          For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this PASSION License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

       3. **Term.**  
          The term of this PASSION License is specified in Section 6(a).

       4. **Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.**  
          The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this PASSION License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. **Downstream recipients.**

            a. **Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material.**  
               Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this PASSION License.

            b. **No downstream restrictions.**  
               You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material and/or any Adapted Materials if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material and/or any Adapted Materials.

       6. **No endorsement.**  
          Nothing in this PASSION License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. **Other rights.**

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this PASSION License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this PASSION License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

## Section 3 -- License Conditions.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material and/or Adapted Materials. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

           - You must not share the **direct download link** to the Licensed Material.

           - You are **prohibited from reposting** the Licensed Material on any other data hosting platforms or websites.

## Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database **for non-commercial purposes only**, provided You do not Share direct download links to the Licensed Material or Adapted Material; and

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material.

## Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable.**

  c. **The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.**

## Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. **This PASSION License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this PASSION License, then Your rights under this PASSION License terminate automatically.**

  b. **Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:**

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

  c. **For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this PASSION License.**

  d. **For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this PASSION License.**

  e. **Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this PASSION License.**

## Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. **The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.**

  b. **Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this PASSION License.**

## Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. **For the avoidance of doubt, this PASSION License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this PASSION License.**

  b. **To the extent possible, if any provision of this PASSION License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this PASSION License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.**

  c. **No term or condition of this PASSION License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.**
